**Project Goal**
Build a microservice‑based e‑commerce platform that uses both Go and Spring Boot services, runs in Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes on AWS, talks to a PostgreSQL database, and supports payment processing.

---

**1. High‑Level Architecture**

* **Go services**: lightweight, high‑performance APIs (for example, product catalog and search).
* **Spring Boot services**: core business domains (for example, user accounts and order handling).
* **PostgreSQL**: single relational database for all services.
* **File storage**: AWS S3 for product images and other static assets.
* **Containerization**: Docker for local development and production images.
* **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (for example on EKS) managing deployments, services, secrets, scaling, and health checks.
* **Payments**: integrate a gateway such as Stripe or PayPal so customers can checkout securely.

---

**2. Prerequisites**
Install and configure:

* Go compiler and tooling (version 1.21 or newer)
* Java 17+ and Maven or Gradle
* Docker and Docker Compose for local testing
* kubectl and either Minikube or AWS EKS command‑line tools
* AWS CLI (to manage IAM roles, ECR, EKS, and S3)
* A running PostgreSQL instance (local or hosted)
* Stripe CLI or SDK (if you choose Stripe)

---

**3. Repository Structure**
Create the following directory structure:

* A top‑level folder named "go‑services" containing subfolders for each Go microservice.
* A folder named "spring‑services" with subfolders for each Spring Boot API.
* An "infra" folder for Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests.
* A "payments" folder with example configurations for your chosen gateway.
* A README file explaining how to get started.

---

**4. Local Development Setup**
Implement:

* Dockerfile for each service with multi-stage builds
* docker-compose.yml to orchestrate all services locally
* Development environment variables and configuration
* Logging and debugging setup for local development

---

**5. Kubernetes Configuration**
Create:

* Deployment manifests for each service with multiple replicas
* Service resources to expose each microservice
* Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive configuration
* Resource requests and limits for all pods
* Health check endpoints and probe configurations

---

**6. AWS Infrastructure**
Set up:

* S3 bucket with appropriate IAM roles and policies
* ECR repositories for each service
* EKS cluster configuration
* CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
* CloudWatch logging and monitoring

---

**7. Database Implementation**
Configure:

* Flyway or Liquibase migrations for Spring Boot services
* Goose migrations for Go services
* Database connection pooling and retry logic
* Environment-based configuration for database access

---

**8. Payment Integration**
Implement:

* Payment provider SDK integration in both Go and Java services
* Secure checkout endpoints with client token generation
* Webhook handlers for payment events
* Payment event logging and audit trail

---

**9. Production‑Ready Implementation**
Add to your services and manifests:

* HTTP liveness and readiness endpoints
* Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscalers
* Centralized logging (ELK or CloudWatch)
* Metrics collection (Prometheus + Grafana)
* Rolling-update deployment strategies
* Network policies and service mesh integration
* Automated CI/CD pipeline with testing and deployment

---

**10. Development Roadmap**
Execute in sequence:

* Scaffold each service with the basic folder and config
* Write core domain models, repository layers, and REST controllers
* Create and test database migrations locally
* Integrate the payment provider and simulate transactions
* Run end‑to‑end tests in Docker Compose
* Deploy to ECR and EKS for staging
* Monitor, optimize resources, and scale services

Use this template to generate the actual code, Dockerfiles, Kubernetes YAML, and CI/CD pipelines. 











Add security configuration to the Spring Boot service

Next steps:
Add user registration and login endpoints.
Implement JWT authentication filter.
Add role-based access control in the security config.
Use BCrypt for password encoding in registration and authentication.




Implement the search service in Go





Create the order service in Spring Boot  ---- IT WORKS RNNNNN




Implement the controller layer with endpoints for creating and fetching orders.
Add DTOs for order creation requests if needed.

If you want, I can help you:
Add a health check endpoint for the order service
Scaffold REST endpoints for order creation and retrieval
Let me know if you’d like to proceed with those or




Implement payment processing with Stripe


Set up Kubernetes manifests
Frontend

Ensure all your microservices are running
Make sure Minikube is properly started (which we were working on earlier)
Verify that the services are accessible at their respective ports



Add AWS S3 integration for product images
